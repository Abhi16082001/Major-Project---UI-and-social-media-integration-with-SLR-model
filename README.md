*Major Project - Interface and Social Media Integration with SLR model*
1. This is the continuation of the Minor Project code available in previous repository
2. In the views.py there is the python code to run the model and it has some changes:
   2.1 Now it will only display the letter when its accuracy will become more than 99.0 %
   2.2 It will not recognize two hand gestures continuosly, you have to move out your hand to recognize the next letter
   2.3 This is done so that you can write the words not just the randome letter.
   2.4 So yes, now you can write the words in this model.
3. Front-end is integrated with the model using the Django Project to make the convinient user interface.
4. Along with this, social media is also integrated, but for now its just WhatsApp
5. After writing the word through hand gestures you can close the camera window and your word will be pasted in the text area in the results page and you can send this message
   to the whatsapp using 'send via whatsapp' button after entering the phone number.
6. So this is it for this SLR project.
